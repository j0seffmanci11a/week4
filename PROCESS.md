The process of making this was long (3.5 hours, voer 2 days) to make this. I had tons of errors, but after rewatching the tutorial I noticed that majority of my codetour dev notes didn't match up with the tutorial and allowed claude to help fix most of thoes errors and cleaned up the code. 

The reason it took me 2 days instead of 1 day, was that this was the first time I've ever done anythink like this, with AI help or none, so this was something "new and scary" for me.

What I learned during this process was that I knew AI isn't perfect, but what supprised me was what you said in the tutorial and how it uses old coding standards and how it updates it's self went going through bugs, and I was supprised on how fast it updated it.
